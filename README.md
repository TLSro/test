# RN2903-Demo

This is a demo project using the Microchip LoRaWAN Library v01.10.00_beta Stack on the RN2903A Module. 
mcc_generated_files/LoRaWAN/lorawan_defs.h has been modified to support the AU915 Frequency Plan. Channels 8 to 15 (Sub Band 2) are enabled for use with The Things Network.
The example uses OTAA and sends "Hello World"
